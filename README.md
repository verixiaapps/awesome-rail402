# Awesome Rail402 [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of SDKs, tools, APIs, agents, and resources for
> [Rail402](https://rail402.app) — the agent-native paid-API marketplace on
> Base, powered by [x402](https://github.com/rail402/agent-services-spec) and USDC.

Rail402 lets AI agents **discover, pay for, and call** APIs autonomously: no API
keys, no accounts — just per-call USDC settlement over the x402 protocol on Base.
